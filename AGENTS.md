# Style

- Two spaces for indentation, no tabs
- Use bash 5 conditionals: use `[[ ]]` for string/file tests and `(( ))` for numeric tests
- In `[[ ]]`, don't quote variables, but do quote string literals when comparing values (e.g., `[[ $branch == "dev" ]]`)
- Prefer `(( ))` over numeric operators inside `[[ ]]` (e.g., `(( count < 50 ))`, not `[[ $count -lt 50 ]]`)
- For strings/paths with spaces, quote them instead of escaping spaces with `\ ` (e.g., `"$APP_DIR/Disk Usage.desktop"`, not `$APP_DIR/Disk\ Usage.desktop`)
- Shebangs must use `#!/bin/bash` consistently (never `#!/usr/bin/env bash`)
- Scripts under `install/` and `migrations/` may be sourced and intentionally omit shebangs

# Command Naming

All commands start with `omarchy-`. Prefixes indicate purpose.

The authoritative command group list lives in `bin/omarchy` in `GROUP_DESCRIPTIONS`. Keep `GROUP_DESCRIPTIONS` updated when adding a new command prefix.

Common prefixes include:

- `cmd-` - check if commands exist, misc utility commands
- `capture-` - screenshots, screen recordings, and other capture tools
- `pkg-` - package management helpers
- `hw-` - hardware detection (return exit codes for use in conditionals)
- `refresh-` - copy default config to user's `~/.config/`
- `restart-` - restart a component
- `launch-` - open applications
- `install-` - install optional software
- `setup-` - interactive setup wizards
- `toggle-` - toggle features on/off
- `theme-` - theme management
- `update-` - update components

Do not maintain a second exhaustive prefix list here. Consult
`GROUP_DESCRIPTIONS` when selecting or checking a command group so this
guidance does not drift from the router.

# Command Metadata

Commands in `bin/` can declare CLI metadata in comments near the top of the file. `bin/omarchy` scans the first 80 lines, and tests expect command metadata to remain valid.

Supported metadata keys:

- `# omarchy:group=...` - override the command group inferred from the filename
- `# omarchy:name=...` - override the command name inferred from the filename
- `# omarchy:summary=...` - short help text
- `# omarchy:args=...` - usage arguments
- `# omarchy:examples=...` - examples separated with ` | `
- `# omarchy:alias=...` / `# omarchy:aliases=...` - alternate routes
- `# omarchy:hidden=true` - hide from default command listings
- `# omarchy:requires-sudo=true` - mark commands that require sudo

Only use `omarchy:examples` where there are args that need explaining.

Prefer explicit metadata for user-facing commands. Keep routes consistent with the filename unless there is a deliberate alias or compatibility route.

Example:

```bash
# omarchy:summary=Take a screenshot
# omarchy:args=[smart|region|windows|fullscreen] [slurp|copy]
# omarchy:examples=omarchy screenshot | omarchy capture screenshot region
```

# Runtime Environment

- `$OMARCHY_PATH` is set at the top level by the uwsm session environment and is always available to Omarchy runtime code.
- Commands in `bin/` and Quickshell QML should rely on `$OMARCHY_PATH` / `Quickshell.env("OMARCHY_PATH")`; do not derive fallback paths from `HOME`, `Quickshell.shellDir`, or re-export/default `OMARCHY_PATH` manually.

# Privileged Commands

- Follow the "Privilege Escalation" section of `default/omarchy-skill/SKILL.md`. It draws the
  `sudo`/`pkexec` line by whether the caller has a terminal to enter a password in, and the repo's
  own scripts follow it.

# Git

- Commits should be atomic: include only one coherent change or fix, and do not mix unrelated work.
- Commit messages should be succinct and describe the change being made.

# Install Scripts

The ISO owns installation orchestration. This repo ships target-side setup commands and reusable setup leaves:

- `bin/omarchy-setup-system` runs root-owned system setup during ISO finalization.
- `bin/omarchy-setup-hardware` runs idempotent hardware-specific setup and is called by `omarchy-setup-system`.
- `bin/omarchy-finalize-user` runs the per-user runtime finalization (skill symlinks, xdg-user-dirs, mime defaults, `install/user/all.sh`). Shipped user defaults are seeded by `/etc/skel` from `omarchy-settings`, not by this command. `bin/omarchy-reinstall-configs` is the explicit destructive resync of those defaults into an existing user's `$HOME`.
- leaf scripts under `install/` are sourced by `run_logged $OMARCHY_INSTALL/path/to/script.sh` and intentionally do not have shebangs.
- avoid `exit` in sourced setup scripts unless intentionally aborting setup.
- use `$OMARCHY_INSTALL` and `$OMARCHY_PATH` instead of hard-coded Omarchy paths.
- keep root-scoped hardware setup under `install/hardware/` and orchestrate it through `install/hardware/all.sh`.
- keep every per-user setup leaf under `install/user/` (including `install/user/hardware/` and `install/user/first-run/`) so it is clear what must run for each user.
- prefer helper commands for package and command checks where available.

Raw `command -v`, `pacman`, and `pacman-key` are acceptable in package-helper contexts where direct package-manager behavior is the point of the script.

# Helper Commands

Use these instead of raw shell commands:

- `omarchy-cmd-missing` / `omarchy-cmd-present` - check for commands
- `omarchy-pkg-missing` / `omarchy-pkg-present` - check for packages (don't use these if you can just use `omarchy-pkg-add`/`omarchy-pkg-drop`)
- `omarchy-pkg-add` - install packages (handles both pacman and AUR)
- `omarchy-pkg-drop` - remove packages; use this instead of raw `pacman -R*`
- `omarchy-notification-send` - send desktop notifications; do not call `notify-send` directly
- `omarchy-hw-asus-rog` - detect ASUS ROG hardware (and similar `hw-*` commands)

Commands installed by Omarchy's default package set are runtime invariants. Invoke them directly; do not add defensive `omarchy-cmd-present` / `omarchy-cmd-missing` checks around them. Use command-presence helpers only for genuinely optional dependencies or code that can run before the default package set is installed.

Exceptions are allowed for migration and package-helper scripts where the helper may not be available yet, where the helper itself is being implemented, or where direct package-manager behavior is required.

# Config Structure

- `config/` - default configs copied to `~/.config/`
- `default/themed/*.tpl` - templates with `{{ variable }}` placeholders for theme colors
- `themes/*/colors.toml` - theme color definitions (accent, background, foreground, red/green/yellow/blue/magenta/cyan and bright_* variants)

# Tests

Run focused automated tests for the area you changed. Current test entry points:

- `./test/all` - aggregate runner for CLI and shell tests; it intentionally does not run graphical acceptance tests
- `./test/cli` - CLI routing, command metadata, theme helpers, and safe dispatch coverage
- `./test/shell` - all Omarchy shell tests under `test/shell.d/`

New Omarchy shell tests should live in `test/shell.d/*-test.sh` so `./test/shell` picks them up automatically. Source `test/shell.d/base-test.sh` for shared root-path discovery, assertions, and Node test helpers.

# Acceptance Tests

The graphical acceptance suite lives in `test/acceptance` with test files under
`test/acceptance.d/*-test.sh`. It exercises a real installed Omarchy desktop,
including session health, shell surfaces, panels, keyboard navigation,
representative applications, and system setup. Source
`test/acceptance.d/base-test.sh` for the shared helpers.

Run acceptance tests in a disposable VM through the sibling `omarchy-iso`
repository, not in the active development session. The suite opens and closes
applications and temporarily changes desktop configuration.

For acceptance-test-only changes, reuse an installed base and sync the suite:

```bash
cd ../omarchy-iso
./bin/omarchy-iso-test release/<iso>.iso --reuse-base --sync-omarchy ../omarchy --no-preview
```

Use `--sync-all ../omarchy` instead of `--sync-omarchy ../omarchy` when the
acceptance run must exercise local `bin/`, `config/`, or `shell/` source too.
Changes to package manifests, installation, finalization, or shipped defaults
require a fresh ISO built from the local checkouts and a run without
`--reuse-base`:

```bash
cd ../omarchy-iso
./bin/omarchy-iso-make --no-boot-offer --local-source ../omarchy ../omarchy-pkgs
./bin/omarchy-iso-test release/<generated-iso>.iso --no-preview
```

Keep unrelated acceptance workflows in separate test files. The runner records
a failed file and continues with the remaining files, which preserves as much
diagnostic coverage as possible. Restore modified user state with traps, close
anything the test opens, and capture every visually distinct state (including
entered input where relevant) as `success-<step>.png`; failure helpers capture
`failure-<step>.png`. The ISO harness collects the screenshots and logs under
its timestamped `test-runs/` directory and opens the screenshots after the run
unless `--no-preview` is passed.

The ISO harness exercises compositor-level shortcuts with QMP virtual keyboard
input. In-guest `wtype` is suitable for typing into focused controls, but it
does not reliably prove that a global Hyprland keybinding works.

# Visual Verification

Visual changes must be verified in the running UI in addition to automated
tests. This includes Omarchy shell styling and layout, panels, menus,
notifications, desktop appearance, animations, transitions, screenshots, and
screen recording flows. Creating an artifact is not sufficient: inspect it for
clipping, overlap, incorrect spacing, stale state, focus problems, and visual
regressions before finishing.

Take a full-screen screenshot without opening the editor:

```bash
omarchy capture screenshot fullscreen save
```

The command prints the saved path and writes to the configured Pictures
directory. Use `omarchy screenshot` for the interactive smart-region flow.
Capture reference and candidate states as separate images when changing a
layer-shell surface or layout, then compare both.

Record a short full-screen video for animation, transition, timing, capture, or
screen-recording changes:

```bash
omarchy screenrecord --fullscreen
# Exercise the changed behavior.
omarchy screenrecord --stop-recording
```

The stop command prints the saved video path in the configured Videos
directory. Review the recording before finishing, and keep it short and focused
on the changed behavior.

For interactive UI work, use `wtype` to simulate keyboard input when available. Example: start the UI in the background, wait briefly for focus, then run `wtype -k Right -k Return` to exercise keyboard selection and confirm the resulting command output or state change. Prefer this over manual-only verification when a UI returns a selected value or changes a symlink/config.

If a launched UI would otherwise remain open, keep track of its PID and stop it
after the screenshot or recording; avoid broad process kills unless checking
with `ps` first.

# Omarchy shell

The Quickshell desktop runs as a single long-running process out of
`shell/`. Hyprland autostart launches it directly with `quickshell -n -p`;
do not start additional standalone Quickshell instances for individual
components.

Run `omarchy-restart-shell` after making changes to QML files.

Plugin contract:

- First-party plugins live directly under `shell/plugins/` or one category
  level deeper, such as `shell/plugins/panels/weather/`. First-party bar-only
  widgets may use adjacent `*.manifest.json` files. Third-party plugins live
  at `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/<id>/` with a `manifest.json` at the root.
- Every plugin manifest declares `schemaVersion`, `id`, `name`, `version`,
  `kinds`, and `entryPoints`. See
  [`docs/omarchy-shell.md`](docs/omarchy-shell.md) and
  `shell/services/PluginRegistry.qml` for the current contract; fields such as
  `activation` are optional.
- Entry-point QML files are `Item`s (not `ShellRoot`), and accept the
  shell-injected properties `omarchyPath`, `shell`, `manifest`, and
  `pluginRegistry` / `barWidgetRegistry` as appropriate.
- Panel / overlay / menu plugins must expose `open(payloadJson)` and
  `close()` lifecycle methods for `shell summon` and `shell hide`.

IPC:

- `bin/omarchy-shell` is the canonical IPC entry point. It forwards to
  the running shell and does not start it. Prefer it over re-implementing
  direct Quickshell socket calls in every CLI.
- The `shell` IPC target exposes lifecycle and configuration methods including
  `ping`, `summon`, `hide`, `toggle`, `call`, `rescanPlugins`, `reloadConfig`,
  `setPluginEnabled`, and `listPlugins`. `shell.qml` also registers
  `image-selector`, which drives the `omarchy.image-picker` panel.
- Individual plugins register their own IPC targets, named for the plugin rather
  than for where they appear: the background switcher registers `background`, and
  bar widgets register one target each — `omarchy.indicators`,
  `omarchy.system-update`, `omarchy.clock`. There is no `bar` target.

Widget files in `shell/plugins/bar/widgets/` contain Nerd Font glyphs as raw
unicode characters. The `Write` and `Edit` tools strip multi-byte
codepoints in some positions — do **not** rewrite widget files wholesale
through those tools. For glyph fixes, use the targeted `Edit` tool with
the surrounding context, or a Python script that inserts codepoints via
`chr(0xXXXXX)`.

# Refresh Pattern

To copy a default config to user config with automatic backup:

```bash
omarchy-refresh-config hypr/hyprland.lua
```

This copies `$OMARCHY_PATH/config/hypr/hyprland.lua` to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`. The argument
is interpolated into both paths and only checked with `[[ -e ]]`, so pass a plain relative path: a
name containing `..` resolves and copies, landing outside `~/.config` rather than being rejected.

# Migrations

Read `docs/migrations.md` before creating or changing migrations.

Migrations are per-user and run through `omarchy-migrate` during `omarchy update` or from the login-time migration notification. Put migrations directly under `migrations/<timestamp>.sh`. Pending state is per-user under `~/.local/state/omarchy/migrations/`, so every user gets a chance to run every migration. Migrations run as the user; privileged work should invoke the appropriate helper or privilege prompt, and no-op when another user already applied it.

To create a new migration, run `omarchy-dev-add-migration --no-edit`.

New migration format:
- File permissions must be `0644` (`-rw-r--r--`); migration runners execute them with `bash -euo pipefail`, not through executable bits
- No shebang line
- Start with an `echo` describing what the migration does
- Use `$OMARCHY_PATH` to reference the omarchy directory
- Prefer helper commands such as `omarchy-cmd-present`, `omarchy-cmd-missing`, `omarchy-pkg-present`, and `omarchy-pkg-missing`

Omarchy 4.0 is upgraded through `bin/omarchy-upgrade-to-quattro`, not through the normal migration runner. Do not add compatibility migrations for old installer layouts; put pre-4 package-layout transition work in the upgrade command instead.

Migrations may use raw `pacman`, `command -v`, or direct config edits when needed for one-off repair work.

# Screensaver

The screensaver launched by the Quickshell idle service (after `idle.screensaver` seconds in `shell.json`) has two runtime prerequisites that are not provided by the base package set or the install scripts:

- `tte` from the `terminaltexteffects` Python package. Install with `pip install --user terminaltexteffects` (or `pipx install terminaltexteffects` if you prefer an isolated install).
- A branding text file at `~/.config/omarchy/branding/screensaver.txt` that `omarchy-screensaver` reads via `tte -i`. The file is plain text shown with a random TTE effect; create the directory and put any content you want displayed.

Without these, `omarchy-launch-screensaver` exits silently at the idle threshold and no screensaver window appears.
